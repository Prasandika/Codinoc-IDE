# Group Project Proposal


## Define the Problem

When software is created by several people together rather than by one person, it can be done very quickly. That is, the development process of the relevant software can be shared with each other. This is an easy task in a company. This is because in a typical software development company all the computers are interconnected so it can be done easily.

But suppose an ordinary team, not a company, does this. There, each other 's computers are not directly connected. Here you have to share the project related to the software created by the team.

Take a look at this example. Imagine that a team is developing a mobile app. Here are the basics: UI Design Process and App Development Process. For the UI design process, you can use online software such as Figma and Lunacy. But think about the app development process. How is it done? The project should be shared with each other, right?

Software such as Visual Studio provides Team support for this problem.
But can everyone use it? Suppose I am a Linux User, another Mac User, another Windows User.

Simply put, this is our problem.

## Solution for the Problem

Our primary objective is to find a solution to this problem. So we think the solution to this is to create a text editor that can be used by anyone or used by any team. After that, we hope to upgrade the Tex Editor to an IDE.

Here we will create a cloud IDE for Web Design.

## Target Users

We primarily target web designers.
In addition to web designers, web-based Mobile or Desktop application designers are also targeted.

The bottom line is that we target designers, not developers.

## Application features and Description

Here are some of the key features of our Cloud IDE:

- Multi Member (Team) Support
- Team Chat
- Built In Live Preview
- Built In Storage Per Team

In addition, there are some basic features that a web design IDE should have

- File and Folder Management
- Full Featured Text Editor
	1. Cut, Copy and Paste
	2. Automatic Indent and Outdent
	3. Handles huge documents (four million lines seems to be the limit!)
	4. Fully Customizable key bindings including Vim and Emacs modes
	5. Search and replace
	6. Highlight matching parentheses
	7. Toggle between soft tabs and real tabs
	8. Displays hidden characters
	9. Drag and drop text using the mouse
	10. Line wrapping
	11. Code folding
	12. Multiple cursors and selections
	13. Cut, Copy and Paste functionality
	14. Live Syntax Checker

- Color Schemes
	1. For User Interface
	2. For Text Editor

And, Languages related to web design such as HTML, JavaScript, Css and languages like SCSS, SASS, LESS are also directly supported.
